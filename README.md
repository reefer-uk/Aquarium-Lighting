# Aquarium-Lighting
First coding project - an automatic lighting controller for aquariums
My first "real" arduino project. 

I've dabbled in simple hardware electronics and built some arduino and Raspberry Pi things by following what others have done, but have never created something myself.

Coding has seemed very daunting to me and attempting to parse my way through others work has left me with headaches and confusion.

Having now done some simple coding projects (JMP's JSL) for work, I'd like to up my game by learning some more formal techniques by creating something I can use and which is fun to me.

The intention is to take something from start to finish and have it be polished enough I'm willing to share it with others while learning coding, embedded hardware, and associated organisational documentation and mental skills - the controller is just the medium.
